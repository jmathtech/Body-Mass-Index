# Body-Mass-Index
This program measures the height and weight class to calculate the total BMI (Body Mass Index) based on user input.

# What I've learned
- Similar calculation from my weight BMI calculator in C++. The variables are included in the class method. [Weight-Class-BMI-Calculator - Github link]https://github.com/jmathtech/Weight-Class-BMI-Calculator

```java
    	double weightPounds = input.nextInt();
	double heightMeters = heightInches * 2.54/100;
	double weightKilos = weightPounds * 453.59/1000;
	double bmi = weightKilos/(heightMeters * heightMeters);
```

# Here is an example
